# Transfer List

<p className="description">
  A transfer list (or "shuttle") enables the user to move one or more list items
  between lists.
</p>

## Basic transfer list

For completeness, this example includes buttons for "move all", but not every transfer list needs these.

<TransferList />
```tsx
<TransferList />
```

## Enhanced transfer list

This example exchanges the "move all" buttons for a "select all / select none" checkbox, and adds a counter.

<SelectAllTransferList />
```tsx
<SelectAllTransferList />
```

## Limitations

The component comes with a couple of limitations:

- It only works on desktop.
  If you have a limited amount of options to select, prefer the Autocomplete component.
  If mobile support is important for you, have a look at #27579.
- There are no high-level components exported from npm. The demos are based on composition.
  If this is important for you, have a look at #27579.
