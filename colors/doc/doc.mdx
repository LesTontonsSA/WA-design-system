# Colors

The palette enables you to modify the color of the components to suit your brand.

## Palette colors

The theme exposes the following palette colors (accessible under `theme.palette.`):

- _primary_ - used to represent primary interface elements for a user. It's the color displayed most frequently across your app's screens and components.
- _secondary_ - used to represent secondary interface elements for a user. It provides more ways to accent and distinguish your product. Having it is optional.
- _error_ - used to represent interface elements that the user should be made aware of.
- _warning_ - used to represent potentially dangerous actions or important messages.
- _info_ - used to present information to the user that is neutral and not necessarily important.
- _success_ - used to indicate the successful completion of an action that user triggered.
